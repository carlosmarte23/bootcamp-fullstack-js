# 🚀 JavaScript Fullstack Bootcamp – Midudev

This repository contains **my personal implementation of the JS Camp Bootcamp by [Midudev](https://github.com/midudev/jscamp)**.

Here I document **my solutions, notes, and lessons learned** throughout the program, with the goal of strengthening my **frontend and backend** skills with modern JavaScript.

---

## 📚 Objective

Learn and practice the full JavaScript stack (HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, SQL, and TypeScript) following Midudev's methodology, building real projects, applying best practices, and maintaining consistent documentation.

---

## 🧱 Repository structure

Each folder represents a bootcamp module.

Inside each one I include exercises, small projects, and a `notes.md` file where I explain what I learned or which challenge I solved.

---

## 🔐 Environment variables (.env)

Some modules (especially backend ones) require environment variables.

- `.env` files are **not committed** to Git (they may contain secrets).
- Each module that needs env vars includes a **`.env.example`** file.
- Setup: copy `.env.example` to `.env` inside that module and adjust values.

Example (macOS/Linux):
cp .env.example .env

Example (Windows PowerShell):
Copy-Item .env.example .env

## 💬 Personal notes

During this process I will use **AI — GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT — as learning assistants**,
but I will always prioritize **understanding and hands-on coding practice**, following the active-learning approach recommended by Midudev.

---

## 💻 Live Demos

As I progress through the bootcamp, different versions of each project will be deployed to various hosting services. This section will be updated with their corresponding live links.

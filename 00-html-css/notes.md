# Module 00 - HTML + CSS

The fist excersice is to create the first two pages of the design for [DevJobs](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/projects/7508115667617706440?pli=1).

## Design

### Home page
![](/00-html-css/Design/index.png)

First I looked at the design and divided the page in 3 sections, the header, the main part and the footer.

I then added the basic structure of the page in index.html using HTML semantic tags where needed and svg images from [tabler.io](https://tabler.io/icons) following the desing.

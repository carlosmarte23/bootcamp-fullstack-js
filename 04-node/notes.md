# Module 04 — Node

Our next step is to learn Node.js. This is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript code outside the browser using the V8 engine. With Node.js, we can use JavaScript to create web applications and APIs, and to build command-line tools. In the bootcamp well start by learning the basics of Node by building simple scripts, using the modern ESM module system, creating a mini CLI and a simple web server.

# Module 02 — React + Vite

The third module of the bootcamp introduces **React using Vite**.

I started by installing the required tools (Node and npm), then created a new React project using Vite. After setting up the environment, I cleaned the default template to keep only the essential files. From there, I rebuilt the job search page as an exact replica of the previous version, which will later be refactored into reusable React components.
